Hello FRC teams!

To use this template for your own code, fork it onto your GitHub and then clone it into the directory of your choice. Then, go through all the TODO comments and modify the values (if neccesary) to fit your own robot.

Note that much of the funcitonalty in this project remains untested for WPILib 2025. If you encounter any problems, feel free to open an issue and I'll help you/your team work through it remotely.
